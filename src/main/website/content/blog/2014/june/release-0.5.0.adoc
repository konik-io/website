The Konik library 1.0 is being scheduled to be released in big steps. Just in time with the official ZUGFeRD announcement we completed our 0.5.0 release.
This is the "in-between" release and it does not support all of the features of ZUGFeRD 1.0. 

=== Release Notes

The Konik domain model can now be considered stable. For the final 1.0 release, we are planning to extend the model without breaking the 
existing API.


A +zip+ https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/io/konik/distribution/0.5.0/distribution-0.5.0.zip[distribution package^, role="download-zip-package"] 
is also available for users without a Build System.

Artifacts are available on the Central Repository by the http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22io.konik%22[io.konik^] Group ID.

== Setup

Or how to integrate the Konik library into a project.

Broadly there are two different ways on how to 
integrate the Konik library into a project. 
Both ways mostly depend upon the type of the environment 
of the application and the Invoice Validator implementation.

Friends of .NET have only one option to choose from. 

=== Java Projects
:lnk_spi: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html
The minimal requirement for Konik is Java 6 although we recommend 
Java 7 and above because of newer JaxB libraries. 
The <<Working with Java 6>> section contains instructions 
on how Java 6 users can overcome these issues.

The Konik Library supports Bean Injections, also 
known as JSR330 or CDI. This means that Konik fits nicely 
in environments with Dependency Injection support. 
The default option for Konik is to use Java 
{lnk_spi}[Service provider interface (SPI)].

==== JEE Environment
If your environment is JEE6 and above include just 

[source,xml,indent=-3,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.konik</groupId>
        <artifactId>konik</artifactId>
        <version>{konik-latest-release}</version>
    </dependency>
----

[source,xml,indent=-3,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.konik</groupId>
        <artifactId>pdfbox-carriage</artifactId> <!--1-->
        <version>{pdfbox-carriage-latest-release}</version>
    </dependency>
----
<1> Alternatively a different PDF carriage can be selected. 
Make sure there is only one PDF carriage on the classpath.

==== Spring
:lnk_spring_docs_jsr330: http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-standard-annotations
:lnk_spring_docs_scanning: http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-scanning-autodetection

Select the dependencies according to the 
<<JEE Environment>> description.
As Konik has an optional dependency to +javax.inject+ also known as 
+JRS330+ which takes not part of Spring by default see 
{lnk_spring_docs_jsr330}[use of JSR 330 Standard Annotations] 
in Spring Documentation.

When using Spring you have to add +javax.inject+ dependency 
to your project, so Spring can use JSR330 annotated components.

[source,xml,indent=-3]
----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>javax.inject</groupId>
        <artifactId>javax.inject</artifactId>
        <version>1</version>
    </dependency>
----

In the next step instruct Spring to also scan for the Konik Library 
components based on the package name preifix +io.konik+.

[source,java,indent=1]
----
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.acme.app.xyz , io.konik")	// <1>
public class SpringApplicationConfig  {
    ...
}
----
<1> Declaring with Spring Annotation to scan for injectable 
	components in package +io.konik+. For alternative XML 
	Configuration refer to {lnk_spring_docs_scanning}[Spring Documentation].   

==== Java standalone
Working in a standalone Java project or any other environment 
which is not JEE6+ or JSR330 compatible.

Followind dependecy is required 
[source,xml,indent=-3,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.konik</groupId>
        <artifactId>konik</artifactId>
        <version>{konik-latest-release}</version>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.konik</groupId>
        <artifactId>pdfbox-carriage</artifactId> <!--1-->
        <version>{pdfbox-carriage-latest-release}</version>
    </dependency>
----
<1> Different PDF carriage can be selected. 
	Make sure there is only one PDF carriage on the classpath.

Recommended for invoice validation

[source,xml,indent=-3,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
    <dependency>
		<groupId>org.apache.bval</groupId>
        <artifactId>bval-jsr303</artifactId>
        <version>0.5</version>
    </dependency>
----


==== Working with Java 6
We recommend Java 7 and above because of newer JaxB library 
which does not contain namespace prefix issues. If you still need to 
work with Java 6 we recommend to use the latest JaxB libraries. 
While from the XML point of view this not a problem, other 
XML implementations who will receive your invoice might still complain about it. 

For Java 6 add the latest JaxB files to your project.

=== Invoice Validator Option
The second option to choose from is the {http://beanvalidation.org/}[Java Bean Validation] Provider. 
With the support of Bean Validation you can verify the correctness 
of your invoice prior transforming it to xml. Currently there two 
Open Source Bean Validation Providers http://hibernate.org/validator[+Hibernate Validator+] 
and http://bval.apache.org[+Apache BVal+].

While Hibernate Validator is superior regarding features BVal has 
less dependencies and is more compact, which makes it a perfect 
companion for a standalone application.

See http://hibernate.org/validator/documentation/getting-started/ 
on what dependencies you might need in your environment.

For BVal just this dependency to your project.

		<groupId>org.apache.bval</groupId>
        <artifactId>bval-jsr303</artifactId>
        <version>0.5</version>
    </dependency>

=== .NET projects
The .NET package consists of +Konik+, +PDFBox-carriage+ & +BVal+ for Invoice Validation. 
Everything is bundled together in one single dll. You can install the Konik library directly via NuGet.

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
 PM> Install-Package ZUGFeRD-NET
----

You can also browse the https://www.nuget.org/packages/ZUGFeRD.NET/[NuGet Konik package] for details.

To help you get started there is also an https://github.com/konik-io/ZUGFeRD.NET-Example[.NET example] available on GitHub.

== Quick Start


The example code from 
{lnk_minimal_latest}[+MinimalInvoice.java+] represents a valid basic invoice and the steps on how to convert and attach an invoice to a PDF. 

Let us step through the code and take a look at the interesting parts.

=== Creating the invoice model
[source,java,indent=-3]
----
include::{lnk_minimal_latest_raw}[tags=createInvoice]
----
<1> A new invoice instance is created with one of the three allowed profiles. BASIC, COMPFORT or EXTENDED
<2> The implementation of the model as a fluent interface makes the creation of the invoice self-explanatory.

=== Transforming the invoice model to XML and vice versa.

[source,java,indent=-3]
----
include::{lnk_minimal_latest_raw}[tags=transformInvoiceToXml]
----
<1> The +InvoiceTransformer+ is responsible for transforming XML to Model and vice versa.   
<2> Transform the given invoice to an OutputStream.
 
=== Append a ZUGFeRD invoice to an existing PDF
This alternative step performs a model conversation. So you don't have to do it yourself.

[source,java,indent=-3]
----
include::{lnk_minimal_latest_raw}[tags=appendInvoiceToPdf]
----
<1> The PdfHandler bridges together the invoice with PDFs. 
<2> Here we append an invoice to an PDF defined as inputPdf. The is written to the resultingPdf output stream.
 
 
=== Extract ZUGFeRD invoice from PDF
This step internally also performs a model conversation.

[source,java,indent=-3]
----
include::{lnk_minimal_latest_raw}[tags=extracInvoiceFromPdf]
----
<1> The PdfHandler also extracts the invoice from a ZUGFeRD PDF. 
<2> Extracts the invoice from an existing PDF provided by the inputZugferdPdfStream. The result is the invoice.
 

=== Validate correctness of a ZUGFeRD Invoice 
This example shows how one can validates the correction of an invoice.

[source,java,indent=-3]
----
include::{lnk_minimal_latest_raw}[tags=validateInvoice]
----
<1> Create a new default +InvoiceValidator+. See the link:#invoice_validator_option[setup section] on how to integrate a Validation Framework into your project.    
<2> Performs the validation by calling the +validate(...)+ method assigning the result to a http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/validation/ConstraintViolation.html[ConstraintViolation] set.
<3> If there aren't any error the resulting Set should't have any elements.
